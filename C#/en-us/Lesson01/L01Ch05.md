Now we will take a detour from the contract itself to introduce another crucial data type: arrays. 

Arrays store multiple variables of the same type in one reference. Its general form looks like this: 

```c#
type[] arrayName; 
```

The type of an array can be value types such as `int` and `bool`, or an object, such as the object we just defined: `Alien`: 

```c#
int[] integers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; 
byte[] bytes = { 23, 43, 52, 15 }; 
string[] weekDays = { "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri" }; 
Alien[] aliens = 
            {
                new Alien(12345678, "Alien1", 0), 
                new Alien(23456789, "Alien2", 1)
            }
```
You can access or change array members like this: 

```c#
Console.WriteLine(integers[0]);  // "1"
integers[0] = 3; 
Console.WriteLine(ingeters[0]);  // "3"

Console.WriteLine(aliens[0].alienName);  // "Alien1"
```

#### Arrays are Objects

Arrays are actually objects, which means, you can declare arrays just like in Chapter 4, with the `new` keyword: 

```c#
int[] integers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }; 
```
This is useful when declaring an empty array to be filled with data later. 

```c#
int[] integers = new int[4]; // initialising an empty array with 4 elements. 
```

It also means each array has multiple fields that can be called. The most common one being `Length`: 

```c# 
string[] names = new string[4]; 
Console.WriteLine(names.Length); // "4"
```

### Instructions: 

An exercise for arrays: 

- In an empty program, initiate an array (`planets`) that contains the name all planets of the solar system. 
- Use `Console.WriteLine()` to print the fourth planet from the sun.
