Our goal is to generate different and randomised XNA's each time the contract is run. To do that, we need random numbers. Luckily, a random number can be acquired from the consensus data on NEO's blockchain. 

#### Block Height

A block is generated on the NEO blockchain roughly every 15 seconds. It records all changes that happened on the network over the last 15 seconds. 

The 'height' of a block is the index of the order in which the block is generated. The first block has a height of 0; And the 'current height' for the network is the number of blocks that have been generated so far - 1. 

We can write something in our contract to 'ask' the network what the current height is: 

```c#
uint blockHeight = Blockchain.GetHeight();
```

#### Consensus Data

For each block generated, there is a randomised ulong number named Consensus Data. Consensus Data is specific to this generated block, and so we need to specify block height when accessing consensus data. 

For example, to access consensus data of the 1000th block, you can write: 
```c#
ulong consensusData = Blockchain.GetHeader(1000).ConsensusData; 
```


### Instructions: 

1. In `RandomNumber()`, get consensus data from the blockchain using `GetHeader()`, and then return it. 

2. In the main method, get the current height from the blockchan and assign it to the variable `blockHeight`

3. In the main method, make a call to RandomNumber(), with blockHeight as its argument.
